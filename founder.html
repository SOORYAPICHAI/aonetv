                    Angelique Monét who holds the Royal Nobility titles of (Her Royal Highness Princess Dame)
                    based upon her lineage, humanitarian efforts, and contribution to the arts, is an American multimedia
                    talent and former Ms. Black South Carolina USA. Monét attended St. Augustines University
                    graduating with a degree in mass communications. Monét is also the first stage actress and
                    ventriloquist. In 2001, she performed on Theater Row her one-woman Off-Broadway show
                    “Multiple Me” written by Edgar Chisholm, where she portrayed several personalities and her
                    ventriloquist figure had multiple personalities in addition to those Monét portrayed. This changed
                    modern day ventriloquism at the start of the millenium. She is one of the “most famous Angelique
                    ever,” and “top 5 sir name Monet along with Jean Claude Monet.” Her image is now seen as a
                    “work of art,” by major corporations from the United States, Europe, Asia to the Middle East the
                    specific image is

                        <h2>EARLY LIFE.</h2>
                        <p>
                            Angelique Monet was raised in Greenville, South Carolina and was raised by her Mother and
                            Grandparents. She suffered from a learning disability and did not talk until the age 5. Once she
                            began talking she was behind in school and was placed in temporary special education by the fifth
                            grade. Through piano classes within one year Monet was ready in some levels for high school. She
                            mentions being bullied which is why she also in this time learned ventriloquism which would later
                            be her art form in pageantry. Through ventriloquism, Monet found her voice.
                            Coming from a lineage of African Americans in politics, Monet is the Grand-daughter of Senator
                            Theo Walker Mitchell of Greenville, South Carolina who was the second African American in the
                            United States of America to receive a major party nomination (Democratic for Governor) and
                            Bishop Johnnie Smith the first African American Republican elected official and first African
                            American co-chairman of the Republican Party of South Carolina often known as “advisor to the
                            Presidents.” She is also related to many pioneers to American politics and civil rights leaders.
